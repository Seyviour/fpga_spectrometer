This is an (ongoing) implementation of an audio spectrometer targetting the GW1NR-9 on the Tang Nano 9K.


PROJECT DETAILS 
_________________

- Audio(8 bits) acquisition is over I2S. I'm working with the INMP441 but any compliant microphone should suffice. 

- The specific version of the Fourier transform used here is the STFT (256 samples); 

- Display is over the HDMI/DVI port on the Tang Nano 9K;
